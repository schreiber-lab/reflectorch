abstract = {Recently, there has been significant interest in applying machine-learning (ML) techniques to the automated analysis of X-ray scattering experiments, due to the increasing speed and size at which datasets are generated. ML-based analysis presents an important opportunity to establish a closed-loop feedback system, enabling monitoring and real-time decision-making based on online data analysis. In this study, the incorporation of a combined one-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) and multilayer perceptron that is trained to extract physical thin-film parameters (thickness, density, roughness) and capable of taking into account prior knowledge is described. ML-based online analysis results are processed in a closed-loop workflow for X-ray reflectometry (XRR), using the growth of organic thin films as an example. Our focus lies on the beamline integration of ML-based online data analysis and closed-loop feedback. Our data demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of ML methods for analyzing XRR curves and Bragg reflections and its autonomous control over a vacuum deposition setup.},

abstract = {X-ray reflectometry (XRR) is a powerful tool for probing the structural characteristics of nanoscale films and layered structures, which is an important field of nanotechnology and is often used in semiconductor and optics manufacturing. This study introduces a novel approach for conducting quantitative high-resolution millisecond monochromatic XRR measurements. This is an order of magnitude faster than in previously published work. Quick XRR (qXRR) enables real time and {\it in situ} monitoring of nanoscale processes such as thin film formation during spin coating. A record qXRR acquisition time of 1.4ms is demonstrated for a static gold thin film on a silicon sample. As a second example of this novel approach, dynamic {\it in situ} measurements are performed during PMMA spin coating onto silicon wafers and fast fitting of XRR curves using machine learning is demonstrated. This investigation primarily focuses on the evolution of film structure and surface morphology, resolving for the first time with qXRR the initial film thinning via mass transport and also shedding light on later thinning via solvent evaporation. This innovative millisecond qXRR technique is of significance for {\it in situ} studies of thin film deposition. It addresses the challenge of following intrinsically fast processes, such as thin film growth of high deposition rate or spin coating. Beyond thin film growth processes, millisecond XRR has implications for resolving fast structural changes such as photostriction or diffusion processes.},

In addition, the influence of experimental errors on the reflectivity curve is discussed, and new features are described that allow the user to include these in the error statistics to improve the fitting and uncertainty estimation.},

abstract = {{\it refnx} is a model-based neutron and X-ray reflectometry data analysis package written in Python. It is cross platform and has been tested on Linux, macOS and Windows. Its graphical user interface is browser based, through a {\it Jupyter} notebook. Model construction is modular, being composed from a series of components that each describe a subset of the interface, parameterized in terms of physically relevant parameters (volume fraction of a polymer, lipid area per molecule {\it etc.}). The model and data are used to create an objective, which is used to calculate the residuals, log-likelihood and log-prior probabilities of the system. Objectives are combined to perform co-refinement of multiple data sets and mixed-area models. Prior knowledge of parameter values is encoded as probability distribution functions or bounds on all parameters in the system. Additional prior probability terms can be defined for sets of components, over and above those available from the parameters alone. Algebraic parameter constraints are available. The software offers a choice of fitting approaches, including least-squares (global and gradient-based optimizers) and a Bayesian approach using a Markov-chain Monte Carlo algorithm to investigate the posterior distribution of the model parameters. The Bayesian approach is useful for examining parameter covariances, model selection and variability in the resulting scattering length density profiles. The package is designed to facilitate reproducible research; its use in {\it Jupyter} notebooks, and subsequent distribution of those notebooks as supporting information, permits straightforward reproduction of analyses.},
