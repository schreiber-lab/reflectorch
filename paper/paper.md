# Summary

We introduce `reflectorch`, a Python package which facilitates the full machine learning pipeline for the data domain of X-ray and neutron reflectivity. Firstly, the package allows the choice of different parameterizations of the scattering length density profile of a thin film and the sampling of the ground truth physical parameters from user-defined ranges. Secondly, the package provides functionality for the fast simulation of reflectivity curves on the GPU using a vectorized implementation of the Abelès matrix formalism [@Abeles1950] and the augmentation of the theoretical curves with noise informed by experimental considerations. The architecture of the neural network as well as the training callbacks and hyperparameters can be easily customized from YAML configurtation files. Notably, our implementation makes use of a special training procedure introduced in our publication [@Munteanu2024], in which prior boundaries for the target parameters are provided alongside the reflectivity curve as an additional input to the neural network.


# Statement of need

X-ray and neutron reflectometry (XRR and NR) are widely-used and indispensable experimental techniques for elucidating the inner structure of thin films. Experimentalists, having measured a reflectivity curve, are faced with the task of obtaining the physical parameters corresponding to an assumed parameterization of the scattering length density (SLD) profile along the depth of the investigated sample. The inverse problem is non-trivial and highly ambiguous due to the lack of phase information and the existence of experimental limitations. Recent years have seen an increased interest in the fast analysis of reflectometry data using machine learning techniques, as such methods could be adapted for in-operando investigations at large scale syncrotron facilities, potentially enabling closed loop experiments [@Pithan2023]. 

Our contribution to the open-source scientific software community is `reflectorch`, a deep learning package built in the Pytorch framework, which posseses a modular, object-oriented and customizable design. Reflectorch enables the user to simulate reflectivity curves in a fast and vectorized manner which leverages the computing power of modern GPUs. The architecture of the neural network as well as the training callbacks and hyperparameters can be easily customized by editing YAML configurtation files. As a result of the special training procedure which incorporates minimum and maximum prior bounds for the parameters as described in [@Munteanu2024], the user in able to leverage its prior knowledge about the investigated thin film at inference time.  

# General workflow

Several types of parameterizations of the scattering length density profile are implemented as `ParametricModels`: the (default) box model parameterization without absorption (the parameter types being layer thicknesses, interlayer roughnesses and real valued layer SLDs), the box model parameterization with absorption (with imaginary valued layer SLDs as an additional parameter type) and a parameterization for multilayers with a repeating unit. The parameters are represented as an instance of the `ParametricParams` class, which encapsulates the parameter values and their prior bounds, also taking care of scaling these values to neural-network friendly ranges. The `PriorSampler` is responsible for sampling the values of the parameters and their prior bounds from their predefined ranges, in which a `SamplingStrategy` can be used to further restrict the values of some parameters with respect to others (such as the interlayer roughness not exceeding a fraction of the thicknesses of the adjacent layers). Based on the sampled parameters and on the momentum transfer (q) values generated by a `QGenerator`, batches of reflectivity curves are simulated and preprocessed by experimentally-informed noise provided by an `IntensityNoiseGenerator` and scaling to a neural network-friendly range by a `CurvesScaler` (which can also restore scaled curves to their original ranges). A `Trainer` class encapsulates the the `DataLoader`, the Pytorch optimizer, as well as the neural network, allowing the training of the model and the saving of the resulting model weights and the history of losses and learning rates. The neural network architecture can be customized, different embedding networks for the reflectivity curves being available. The training process can be enriched with additional functionality using callback objects. 

# Related Work

There are several well-established packages designed for the classical analysis of X-ray and neutron reflectivity data such as `GenX` [@GlaviGenX], `refnx` [@NelsonRefnx] and `refl1d` [@Maranville2020]. While several machine learning approaches pertaining to X-ray or neutron reflectometry have been proposed in various publications, `mlreflect` [@Greco2022Neural] is the only other properly packaged and documented software. Previously developed in our research group, `mlreflect` is built in the Tensorflow deep learning framework and has limited functionality compared to `reflectorch`. Still, it has been successfully adopted for usage by people in the scattering community such as in the publication [@Schumi-Marecek2024]. 


<!-- # Mathematics

Single dollars ($) are required for inline mathematics e.g. $f(x) = e^{\pi/x}$

Double dollars make self-standing equations:

$$\Theta(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{l}
0\textrm{ if } x < 0\cr
1\textrm{ else}
\end{array}\right.$$

You can also use plain \LaTeX for equations
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fourier}
\hat f(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{i\omega x} dx
\end{equation}
and refer to \autoref{eq:fourier} from text.
